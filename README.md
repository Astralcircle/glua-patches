# gLua Patches
A collection of fixes and improvements aimed at improving the game experience and performance of Garry's Mod.

#### NOTE: The source code for `Random Patches` has been reworked and rewritten in `Lua`.

#### NOTE: The name of this addon was also changed in order to reset the absurdly overstated version to a more adequate one.
