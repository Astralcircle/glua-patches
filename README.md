## Where is Lua code?
Written in [Yuescript](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript), compiled Lua code can be found in [releases](https://github.com/Pika-Software/random-patches/releases) and [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2806290767), or you can compile it yourself using compiled [Yuescript Compiler](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript/releases/latest).
