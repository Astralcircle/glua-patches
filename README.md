## Where is Lua code?
Written in [Yuescript](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript), compiled Lua code can be found in [releases](https://github.com/Pika-Software/random-patches/releases) and [lua branch](https://github.com/Pika-Software/random-patches/tree/lua), or you can compile it yourself using compiled [Yuescript Compiler](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript/releases/latest).
